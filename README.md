# MAPPING EARTHQUAKES CHALLENGE

## OVERVIEW

### You are a Data Visualization Specialist assigned with the Disaster Reporting Network, a non-profit company that provides data driven story telling on disasters around the world.  Your mission is to build insightful visualizations with interactive data including features on earthquakes around the world.  You are working for Basil, the head of the earthquake response team, and he and his team intend to make interactive earthquake visualization more appealing to viewers by presenting the visualizations on Desktops and mobile devices.  The visualizations will use the latest GeoJSON data from the USGS website and work with JavaScript, Leaflet and DS libraries to plot the data on a Mapbox API map using an API request.  The project has so far created world earthquake maps with markers, popups, legends and layers all showing earthquakes locations, magnitudes and other features from the last 7 days.

### The current project objectives are as follows:

### Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate layer data to the earthquake map.

### Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake layer data to the earthqiake map.

### Deliverable 3: Add a dark option layer to the earthquake map with all options displayed on the webpage.

## RESOURCES

### JavaScript

### Leaflet

### DS3 Libraries

### VS Code

### Chrome Dev Tools

### Mapbox.API

### Website: USGS.Gov

## RESULTS

### The goals of this project were fully established and can be viewed in the following screenshots:

### Deliverable 1: The earthquake map without the control layer showing.
